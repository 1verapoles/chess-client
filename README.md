# Chess

â™ž Mobile-first Chess in JavaScript.

Play it: https://chess.yvesgurcan.com.

## How does it work?

- The game state and the game view are separated.
- The view re-renders as the state changes.
- Vectors are used to translate the position of the pieces.


## Setup

You know the drill. `npm i` and all that :)
